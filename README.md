# MTO_beerpong_robot
Mechatronic design, Master's course of EM and EA-ICT engineering technology at UHasselt and KULeuven.
The robot will identify and aim for cups placed on a table with a distance between 1 and 1.5 meters.
- Identification and localisation with vision
- Distance measurement with Sharp IR sensor
- 3 stepper and 1 servo for the mechatronics

In this repo, the arduino code is hosted for the analog sensor and the motor controls. But also, the code for the calculations and vision detection with a raspberry pi.
